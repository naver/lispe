# LispE: Lisp Elémentaire
  
Hello,

Welcome to __Lisp Elémentaire__, a version of Lisp that is ultra-minimal but contains all the basic instructions of the language. The code also comes with a small internal editor from another NAVER's project: [TAMGU](https://github.com/naver/tamgu).

The main goal of __LispE__ is to provide a multi-platform language that can harness the power of functional languages with array languages.
The real strength of the Lisp language, of which _LispE_ is a dialect, is its very simple but incredible versatile formalism that helps combining all these programming trends together in one single language.

I based a large part of this work on the following article: [The Root of Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html).

* The description of the language is available here: [Introduction to LispE](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/1.-Introduction)
* A help to the available functions is here: [LispE Language Description](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/5.-Description-of-Functions,-Operators-and-Libraries)
* The wiki index is here: [HOME](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki)


# CHECK binaries

We have stashed [here](https://github.com/naver/lispe/tree/master/binaries) precompiled versions for Window and Mac OS (including M1)...

# Modern Functional Properties

__LispE__ provides also some interesting properties such as: [Data Structures](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/6.7-Data-Structures)

Finally, __LispE__ can also be used as a _Shell_: [Shell](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/7.-Shell)

Come and discover __LispE__: the __Lisp Elémentaire__.

## Play with it

We provide a fun little program to discover some of the most interesting aspects of LispE: [minzork](https://github.com/naver/lispe/blob/master/examples/patterns/minizork_en.lisp)

_Have a look and try it_
