# LispE: Lisp Elémentaire
  
Hello,

Welcome to __Lisp Elémentaire__, a version of Lisp that is ultra-minimal but contains all the basic instructions of the language. The code also comes with a small internal editor from another NAVER's project: [TAMGU](https://github.com/naver/tamgu).

__LispE__ has different goals:
* To show how to easily implement a powerful and extensible _Lisp_ interpreter in _C++_.
* To provide a real Lisp language that will allow you to discover a really fascinating language ...
* To provide a code that can be compiled on any Linux or Mac OS machine, without any fuss

I based a large part of this work on the following article: [The Root of Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html).

* The description of the language is available here: [Introduction to LispE](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/1.-Introduction)
* A help to the available functions is here: [LispE Language Description](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/6.-Help)
* The wiki index is here: [HOME](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki)


__LispE__ provides also some interesting properties such as: [Data Structures](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/6.2-Data-Structures)

Finally, __LispE__ can also be used as a _Shell_: [Shell](https://github.com/naver/lispe/wiki/7.-Shell)

Come and discover __LispE__: the __Lisp Elémentaire__.

```
NOTE: Due to the lockdown, we have not been able to fully test the Windows version.
