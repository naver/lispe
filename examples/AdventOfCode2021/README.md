# Advent of Code 

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

## LispE

We have used _LispE_ to solve some of them.

However it should be noted that the puzzle data are _different from one user to another_ . I stored my own values in different text files, in the directory _data_ , each with a specific name that connects it to its code.

If you want to test it with your own values, you should replace the values in the text files with your own.
